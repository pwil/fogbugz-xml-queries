fogbugz-xml-queries
===================

This project is a collection of fogbugz XML API queries that you can use out of the box, as templates for your own work, or as Python code examples.

The three goals for this project are:

1) Provide a set of immediately useful FogBugz API queries

2) Learn and understand how to use the FogBugz XML API and the Beautiful Soup layer included in the FogBugz API kit

3) Provide Python code examples as a learning tool

This project uses the freely available FogBugz XML API access code, documentation, and sample code.  Thanks to everyone who did that initial work.
